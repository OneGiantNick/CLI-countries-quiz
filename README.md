# CLI-countries-quiz
A quick quiz that I've created on the CLI to see how many countries you can name

One issue is that countries can be referred to by different names. (e.g. USA instead of United States of America or Republic of Korea instead of South Korea)
May integrate a GUI or make this quiz into a webapp in the future
